Subject: [PATCH] tests: our init is not busybox

Since we are using 'bash' as the init (see our updates to the busybox
template) we can't compare '/sbin/init' and 'busybox'. Actually we are
really only interested in the fact 'cmp' is being run and not the
result, so simplify by comparing '/sbin/init' to itself.
