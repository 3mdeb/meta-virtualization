MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The warning has been present since commit 32b37181ea (with no purpose stated).
Support for dynamically linked Busybox has been added since commit bf6cc73696.
Haven't encountered any issues with dynamically linked Busybox in my last
2 years' testing.
